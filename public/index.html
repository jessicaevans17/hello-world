    <p>Board games have been a life-long hobby of mine. Growing up, I was always bugging my family and friends to play the standards, like Yahtzee, Scrabble, or, Monopoly. However, it wasn’t until later in life that I had my board game horizons broadened and was introduced the many, many, many, many different styles of games, “deck builders”, “co-ops”, “legacy”, “secret identity”, etc. One of my favorite things to do is to go meet up with friends and learn a new board game. </p>
